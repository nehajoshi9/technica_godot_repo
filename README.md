## Inspiration
We were inspired by 2D side-scrolling platformer games, but decided that we wanted to make our project educational and teach users about the environment.

## What it does
A user controls a character that jumps on platforms in a forest environment. As she runs, she learns educational facts about the environment and tries to collect as much litter off the ground as possible.

## How we built it
We used the 2D game engine platform Godot in order to create the game, and programmed in GDScript. We used an open source GitHub repo (https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_2d_platformer) for basic game elements (collisions, character control), as well as the platform tiles, but we designed most of the art, many important game functionalities, educational aspect, and created the background music ourselves. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were initially unfamiliar with the GitHub platform and initially had difficulty sharing files. It also took us some time to familiarize ourselves with Godot and GDScript. We had also set some more ambitious goals for our project, which we were unable to meet within the deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of our user interface and ability to create a game with a positive impact.

## What we learned
We learned how to use GitHub and Godot

## What's next for Eartheart
Adding more features like other characters the main character can interact with.
